# Proposals

You have to be a member to submit a proposal. To become a member, you need to ask one of the current member to submit a proposal. If the proposal passes, a membership NFT will be minted and transferred to you. 

As you submit your proposal, keep the following questions in mind:

- Is it coherent with the overall objective of the DAO? 
- Does it meet one of the criteria described in the DAO Manifesto? 
- Can you prove what you're saying?
- Is the requested amount reasonable given the current state of the DAO treasury?
- What's the expected impact of your action?

A good proposal should be as much documented as possible to make it easy for the DAO members to verify things. It is recommended to attach videos, press articles, photos, testimonials, invoices, etc.

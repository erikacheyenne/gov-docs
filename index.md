# Welcome! âœ¨

[Gov](https://github.com/w3hc/gov-docs) is a DAO template built with Open Zeppelin's Governor contract in combination with NFTs.

The goal of the project is to **provide a coordination tool that fits the needs of everyday people**. Orgs, federations of orgs, activists, neighborhoods, stewards of the commons, collectives, and other communities can use to organize themselves.

We want DAOs to be secure, scalable and easy to use.

## Intro

In a [recent post](http://bafybeieaa73llmb6bkq5dau4k2goj5joc5yfqreloowy3aysfcjrsjmqb4.ipfs.localhost:8080/general/2022/09/20/daos.html), Vitalik Buterin wrote:

DAOs are basically communities that set their operating rules on-chain, meaning that no one except the DAO members can modify these rules. It always ways tricky to allow people who are not familiar with the crypto thing to just use these powerful techniques. [Tally](tally.xyz) provides an excellent interface to monitor DAOs, and [Open Zeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) worked hard to offer a very complete set of smart contracts. Now that the missing parts are finally here, it's time to take advantage of them.

Gov includes one of the strongest voting system in existence. DAO members can vote to:

- Add a member
- Ban a member
- Edit its manifesto
- Allocate the funds of the DAO treasury

"On what do we vote?" would you ask. This depends on your own collective's objective. The **statement of intent** of your DAO can be written in the manifesto, which also includes the criteria for incoming proposals, info about the DAO members, and also some legal aspects related to your DAO. You as an independent and self-organized group of people are technically the only ones allowed to take these executive decisions. 

One member, one vote.
